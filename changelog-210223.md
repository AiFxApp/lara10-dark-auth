```

Meta (from the Greek μετά, meta, meaning "after" or "beyond") 
is a prefix meaning "more comprehensive" or "transcending".

In modern nomenclature, meta- can also serve as a prefix 
meaning self-referential, as a field of study or endeavor 
( metatheory: theory about a theory; metamathematics: 
    mathematical theories about mathematics; 
    meta-axiomatics or meta-axiomaticity: 
    axioms about axiomatic systems; 
    metahumor: joking about the ways humor is expressed; etc.
).
